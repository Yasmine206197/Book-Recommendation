## How It Works:
####### Data Preprocessing:
 Combines the title and authors to create a unified content field.
##### Embedding Generation:
# Uses the SentenceTransformer model to generate embeddings for the book content.
# Similarity Calculation:
# Computes pairwise cosine similarity between book embeddings to find related books.
# User Interaction:
# Users input a book title in the Streamlit app.
# The app retrieves the top 5 most similar books based on cosine similarity.
# Recommendations:
# Displays the recommended books along with their authors.
